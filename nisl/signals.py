    Apply a filter to remove signal below the `low` frequency and above the

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals: numpy array (1D sequence or n_sources x time_series)
        Signals to be filtered

    sampling_rate: float
        Number of samples per time unit (sample frequency)

    low_pass: float, optional
        If specified, signals above this frequency will be filtered (low pass)

    high_pass: float, optional
        If specified, signals below this frequency will be filtered (high pass)

    order: integer, optional
        Order of the butterworth filter. When filtering signals, the
        butterworth filter has a decay to avoid ringing. Increase the order
        sharpens the decay.

    copy: boolean, optional
        If false, apply filter inplace.

    Returns
    -------
    filtered_signals: numpy array
        Signals filtered according to the parameters
