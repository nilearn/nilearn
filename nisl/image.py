    """ Return confounds signals extracted from input signals with highest
        variance.

        Parameters
        ==========
        niimgs: niimg
            4D image.

        mask_img: niimg
            If provided, confounds are extracted from voxels inside the mask.
            If not provided, all voxels are used.

        n_confounds: int
            Number of confounds to return

        percentile: float
            Highest-variance signals percentile to keep before computing the
            singular value decomposition.
            mask_img.sum() * percentile must be greater than n_confounds.

        detrend: bool
            If True, detrend signals before processing.

        Returns
        =======
        v: numpy.ndarray
            highest variance confounds. Shape: (number of scans, n_confounds)

        Notes
        ======
        This method is related to what has been published in the literature
        as 'CompCor' (Behzadi NeuroImage 2007).

        The implemented algorithm does the following:
        - compute sum of squares for each signals (no mean removal)
        - keep a given percentile of signals with highest variance (percentile)
        - compute an svd of the extracted signals
        - return a given number (n_confounds) of signals from the svd with
          highest singular values.

    Apply a Gaussian filter along the three first dimensions of arr.

    Parameters
    ==========
    niimgs: niimgs or iterable of niimgs
        One or several niimage(s), either 3D or 4D.

    smooth: scalar or numpy.ndarray
        Smoothing strength, as a Full-Width at Half Maximum, in millimeters.
        If a scalar is given, width is identical on all three directions.
        A numpy.ndarray must have 3 elements, giving the FWHM along each axis.

        of non-finite values is needed)

    =======
