    """ Return confounds signals extracted from input signals with highest

        Parameters
        ==========
        niimgs: niimg
            4D image.

        mask_img: niimg
            If provided, confounds are extracted from voxels inside the mask.
            If not provided, all voxels are used.

        n_confounds: int
            Number of confounds to return

        percentile: float
            Highest-variance signals percentile to keep before computing the
            singular value decomposition.
            signals.shape[0] * percentile must be greater than n_confounds.

        detrend: bool
            If True, detrend signals before processing.

        Returns
        =======
        v: numpy.ndarray
            highest variance confounds. Shape: (number of scans, n_confounds)

        Notes
        ======
        This method is related to what has been published in the literature
        as 'CompCor' (Behzadi NeuroImage 2007).

        The implemented algorithm does the following:
        - compute sum of squares for each signals (no mean removal)
        - keep a given percentile of signals with highest variance (percentile)
        - compute an svd of the extracted signals
        - return a given number (n_confounds) of signals from the svd with
          highest singular values.
