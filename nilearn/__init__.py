"""
Machine Learning module for NeuroImaging in python
--------------------------------------------------

Documentation is available in the docstrings and online at
http://nilearn.github.io.

Contents
--------
Nilearn aims at simplifying the use of the scikit-learn package in the context of
neuroimaging. It provides specific input/output functions, algorithms and
visualization tools.

Submodules
---------
datasets                --- Utilities to download NeuroImaging datasets
decoding                --- Decoding tools and algorithms
decomposition           --- Includes a subject level variant of the ICA
                            algorithm called Canonical ICA
connectome              --- Set of tools for computing functional connectivity matrices
                            and for sparse multi-subjects learning of Gaussian graphical models
image                   --- Set of functions defining mathematical operations
                            working on Niimg-like objects
input_data              --- includes scikit-learn tranformers and tools to
                            preprocess neuro-imaging data
masking                 --- Utilities to compute and operate on brain masks
mass_univariate         --- Defines a Massively Univariate Linear Model
                            estimated with OLS and permutation test
plotting                --- Plotting code for nilearn
region                  --- Set of functions for extracting region-defined
                            signals
signal                  --- Set of preprocessing functions for time series
