    Use preset strategy to load confounds from :term:`fMRIPrep`.

    `load_confounds_strategy` provides an interface to select confounds
    based on past literature with limited parameters for user customisation.

    .. versionadded:: 0.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_files : path to processed image files, optionally as a list.
        Processed nii.gz/dtseries.nii/func.gii file reside in a
        :term:`fMRIPrep` generated functional derivative directory (i.e.The
        associated confound files should be in the same directory as the image
        file). As long as the image file, confound related tsv and json are in
        the same directory with BIDS-compliant names,
        :func:`nilearn.interfaces.fmriprep.load_confounds` can retrieve the
        relevant files correctly.

        - `nii.gz` or `dtseries.nii`: path to files, optionally as a list.
        - `func.gii`: list of a pair of paths to files, optionally as a list
          of lists.

    denoise_strategy : {'simple', 'srubbing', 'compcor', 'ica_aroma'}
        Name of preset denoising strategies. Each strategy has a set of
        associated configurable parameters. For customiseable parameters,
        please see the table in Notes.

        - 'simple': Load confounds for a simple denoising strategy commonly
          used in resting state functional connectivity, described in
          :footcite:`Fox2005`. With the global signal regression, this approach
          can remove confounds without compromising the temporal degrees of
          freedom.
        - 'srubbing': Load confounds for scrubbing described in
          :footcite:`Power2012`. This approach can reliably remove the
          impact of high motion volumes in functional connectome, however, it
          might not be suitable with subjects with high motion (more than 50%
          timeseries flagged as high motion). One should adjust the threshold
          based on the characteristics of the dataset, or remove high motion
          subjects from the dataset.
        - 'compcor': Load confounds using the CompCor strategy from
          :footcite:`Behzadi2007`. CompCor estimates noise through principal
          component analysis on regions that are unlikely to contain signal.
          Thus it might not be a suitable approach for researchers who want
          explicit description of the source of noise. Empirically, Compcor
          has shown similar effect of removing physiological noise as methods
          that explicitly model and remove physiology signals. Compcor can
          suffer from loss of temporal degrees of freedom when using explained
          variance as the noise component estimation as the number of compcor
          component can be really high. Please refer to :term:`fMRIPrep`
          documentation for more details.
        - 'ica_aroma': Load confounds for non-aggresive ICA-AROMA strategy
          described in :footcite:`Pruim2015`. The strategy requires
          :term:`fMRIPrep` outputs generated with `--use-aroma` suffixed with
          `desc-smoothAROMAnonaggr_bold`. ICA-AROMA increases the run time of
          :term:`fMRIPrep`, however, the strategy performs well in various
          benchmarks (:footcite:`Ciric2017`, :footcite:`Parker2018`).
          See Notes for more details about this option.

    Other keyword arguments:
        See additional parameters associated with `denoise_strategy` in
        Notes and refer to the documentation of
        :func:`nilearn.interfaces.fmriprep.load_confounds`.

    Returns
    -------
    confounds : pandas.DataFrame, or list of
        A reduced version of :term:`fMRIPrep` confounds based on selected
        strategy and flags.
        An intercept is automatically added to the list of confounds.
        The columns contains the labels of the regressors.

    sample_mask : None, numpy.ndarray, or list of
        When no volume requires removal, the value is None.
        Otherwise, shape: (number of scans - number of volumes removed, )
        The index of the niimgs along time/fourth dimension for valid volumes
        for subsequent analysis.
        This attribute should be passed to parameter `sample_mask` of
        :class:`nilearn.maskers.NiftiMasker` or
        :func:`nilearn.signal.clean`.
        Volumes are removed if flagged as following:

        - Non-steady-state volumes (if present)
        - Motion outliers detected by scrubbing

    2. ICA-AROMA is implemented in two steps in :footcite:`Pruim2015`:

        i. A non-aggressive denoising immediately after :term:`ICA`
        classification.
        A linear regression estimates signals with all independent
        components as predictors. A partial regression is then applied to
        remove variance associated with noise independent components.
        :term:`fMRIPrep` performs this step and generates files in
        `MNI152NLin6Asym` template, suffixed with
        `desc-smoothAROMAnonaggr_bold`.

        One can produce `desc-smoothAROMAnonaggr_bold` in other spatial
        templates, please refer to :term:`fMRIPrep` documentation on ICA-AROMA
        `<https://fmriprep.org/en/latest/workflows.html#ica-aroma>`_

        ii. Confound regression step (mean signals from WM and CSF).
        Confound regressors generated by this function with
        `denoise_strategy="ica_aroma"`.

        For more discussion regarding choosing the nuisance regressors before
        or after denoising with ICA-AROMA has a detriment on outcome measures,
        please see notebook 5.
