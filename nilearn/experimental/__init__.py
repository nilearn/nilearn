"""The :mod:`nilearn.experimental` module provides importable modules that \
enable the use of experimental features.

.. warning::

    All features in the ``nilearn.experimental`` module
    are experimental and subject to change.

    They are included in the nilearn package
    to gather early feedback from users about prototypes of new features.
    Changes may break backwards compatibility
    without prior notice or a deprecation cycle.
    Moreover, some features may be incomplete
    or may have been tested less thoroughly than the rest of the library.

    Use those features at your own risks!
