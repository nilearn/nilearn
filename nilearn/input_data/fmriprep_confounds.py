    Use confounds from fmriprep.

    To enable easy confound variables loading from fMRIprep outputs,
    `fmriprep_confounds` provides an interface that groups subsets of confound
    variables into noise components and their parameters. It is possible to
    fine-tune a subset of noise components and their parameters through this
    function.

    The implementation will only support fMRIPrep functional derivative
    directory from the 1.2.x series. The `compcor` noise component requires
    1.4.x series or above.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_files : path to processed image files, optionally as a list.
        Processed nii.gz/dtseries.nii/func.gii file reside in a fmriprep
        generated functional derivative directory (i.e.The associated confound
        files should be in the same directory as the image file). As long as
        the image file, confound related tsv and json are in the same
        directory with BIDS-complied names, `fmriprep_confounds` can retrieve
        the relevant files correctly.

        - `nii.gz` or `dtseries.nii`: path to files, optionally as a list.
        - `func.gii`: list of a pair of paths to files, optionally as a list
          of lists.

    strategy : list of strings, default ["motion", "high_pass", "wm_csf"]
        The type of noise components to include.

        - "motion":  head motion estimates.
        - "high_pass" discrete cosines covering low frequencies.
        - "wm_csf" confounds derived from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid.
        - "global" confounds derived from the global signal.
        - "compcor" confounds derived from CompCor :footcite:`BEHZADI200790`.
        - "ica_aroma" confounds derived from ICA-AROMA :footcite:`Pruim2015`.
        - "scrub" regressors for :footcite:`Power2014` scrubbing approach.

        For each supplied strategy, associated parameters will be applied.
        Otherwise, any values supplied to the parameters are ignored.

    motion : {'basic', 'power2', 'derivatives', 'full'}
        Type of confounds extracted from head motion estimates.

        - "basic" translation/rotation (6 parameters)
        - "power2" translation/rotation + quadratic terms (12 parameters)
        - "derivatives" translation/rotation + derivatives (12 parameters)
        - "full" translation/rotation + derivatives + quadratic terms + power2d
          derivatives (24 parameters)

    fd_threshold : float, default 0.2
        Framewise displacement threshold for scrub (default = 0.2 mm)

    std_dvars_threshold : float, default 3
        Standardized DVARS threshold for scrub (default = 3).
        DVARs is defined as root mean squared intensity difference of volume N
        to volume N+1 :footcite:`Power2012`. D referring to temporal derivative
        of timecourses, VARS referring to root mean squared variance over
        voxels.

    wm_csf : {'basic', 'power2', 'derivatives', 'full'}
        Type of confounds extracted from masks of white matter and
        cerebrospinal fluids.

        - "basic" the averages in each mask (2 parameters)
        - "power2" averages and quadratic terms (4 parameters)
        - "derivatives" averages and derivatives (4 parameters)
        - "full" averages + derivatives + quadratic terms + power2d derivatives
          (8 parameters)

    global_signal : {'basic', 'power2', 'derivatives', 'full'}
        Type of confounds extracted from the global signal.

        - "basic" just the global signal (1 parameter)
        - "power2" global signal and quadratic term (2 parameters)
        - "derivatives" global signal and derivative (2 parameters)
        - "full" global signal + derivatives + quadratic terms + power2d
          derivatives (4 parameters)

    scrub : {'full', 'basic'}
        Type of scrub of frames with excessive motion :footcite:`Power2014`

        - "basic" remove time frames based on excessive framewise displacement
          and DVARS.
        - "full" also remove continuous segments containing fewer than 5
          volumes.

        One-hot encoding vectors are added as regressors for each scrubbed
        frame.

    compcor : {'anat_combined', 'anat_separated', 'temporal',
    'temporal_anat_combined', 'temporal_anat_separated'}

        .. warning::
            Require fmriprep >= v:1.4.0.

        Type of confounds extracted from a component based noise correction
        method :footcite:`BEHZADI200790`.

        - "anat_combined" noise components calculated using a white matter and
          CSF combined anatomical mask
        - "anat_separated" noise components calculated using white matter mask
          and CSF mask compcor separately; two sets of scores are concatenated
        - "temporal" noise components calculated using temporal compcor
        - "temporal_anat_combined" components of "temporal" and "anat_combined"
        - "temporal_anat_separated" components of "temporal" and
          "anat_separated"

    n_compcor : "all" or int, default "all"
        The number of noise components to be extracted.
        For acompcor_combined=False, and/or compcor="full", this is the number
        of components per mask.
        "all": select all components (50% variance explained by fMRIPrep
        defaults)

    ica_aroma : {'full', 'basic'}

        - "full": use fMRIprep output `~desc-smoothAROMAnonaggr_bold.nii.gz`.
        - "basic": use noise independent components only.

    demean : boolean, default True
        If True, the confounds are standardized to a zero mean (over time).
        When `sample_mask` is not None, the mean is calculated on retained
        volumes.

    Returns
    -------
    confounds : pandas.DataFrame, or list of
        A reduced version of fMRIprep confounds based on selected strategy
        and flags.
        An intercept is automatically added to the list of confounds.
        The columns contains the labels of the regressors.

    sample_mask : None, numpy.ndarray, or list of
        When no volumns require removal, the value is None.
        Otherwise, shape: (number of scans - number of volumes removed, )
        The index of the niimgs along time/fourth dimension for valid volumes
        for subsequent analysis.
        This attribute should be passed to parameter `sample_mask` of
        :class:`nilearn.input_data.NiftiMasker` or
        :func:`nilearn.signal.clean`.
        Volumns are removed if flagged as following:

        - Non-steady-state volumes (if present)
        - Motion outliers detected by scrubbing

    Notes
    -----
    The noise components implemented in this class are adapted from
    :footcite:`Ciric2017`. Band-pass filter is replaced by high-pass filter.
    Low-pass filters can be implemented, e.g., through `NifitMaskers`. Other
    aspects of the preprocessing listed in :footcite:`Ciric2017` are controlled
    through fMRIprep, e.g. distortion correction.
