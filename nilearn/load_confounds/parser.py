class Confounds:
    """
    Confounds from fmriprep

    Parameters
    ----------
    strategy : list of strings
        The type of noise confounds to include.
        "motion" head motion estimates.
        "high_pass" discrete cosines covering low frequencies.
        "wm_csf" confounds derived from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid.
        "global" confounds derived from the global signal.
        "ica_aroma" confounds derived from ICA-AROMA.
        "scrub" regressors for Power 2014 scrubbing approach.

    motion : string, optional
        Type of confounds extracted from head motion estimates.
        "basic" translation/rotation (6 parameters)
        "power2" translation/rotation + quadratic terms (12 parameters)
        "derivatives" translation/rotation + derivatives (12 parameters)
        "full" translation/rotation + derivatives + quadratic terms + power2d derivatives (24 parameters)

    n_motion : float
        Number of pca components to keep from head motion estimates.
        If the parameters is strictly comprised between 0 and 1, a principal component
        analysis is applied to the motion parameters, and the number of extracted
        components is set to exceed `n_motion` percent of the parameters variance.
        If the n_components = 0, then no PCA is performed.

    fd_thresh : float, optional
        Framewise displacement threshold for scrub (default = 0.2 mm)

    std_dvars_thresh : float, optional
        Standardized DVARS threshold for scrub (default = 3)

    wm_csf : string, optional
        Type of confounds extracted from masks of white matter and cerebrospinal fluids.
        "basic" the averages in each mask (2 parameters)
        "power2" averages and quadratic terms (4 parameters)
        "derivatives" averages and derivatives (4 parameters)
        "full" averages + derivatives + quadratic terms + power2d derivatives (8 parameters)

    global_signal : string, optional
        Type of confounds extracted from the global signal.
        "basic" just the global signal (1 parameter)
        "power2" global signal and quadratic term (2 parameters)
        "derivatives" global signal and derivative (2 parameters)
        "full" global signal + derivatives + quadratic terms + power2d derivatives (4 parameters)

    scrub : string, optional
        Type of scrub of frames with excessive motion (Power et al. 2014)
        "basic" remove time frames based on excessive FD and DVARS
        "full" also remove time windows which are too short after scrubbing.
        one-hot encoding vectors are added as regressors for each scrubbed frame.

    compcor : string, optional
        Type of confounds extracted from a component based noise correction method
        "anat" noise components calculated using anatomical compcor
        "temp" noise components calculated using temporal compcor
        "full" noise components calculated using both temporal and anatomical

    n_compcor : int or "auto", optional
        The number of noise components to be extracted. For acompcor_combined=False,
        and/or compcor="full", this is the number of components per mask.
        Default is "auto": select all components (50% variance explained by fMRIPrep defaults)

    acompcor_combined: boolean, optional
        If true, use components generated from the combined white matter and csf
        masks. Otherwise, components are generated from each mask separately and then
        concatenated.

    ica_aroma : None or string, optional
        None: default, not using ICA-AROMA related strategy
        "basic": use noise IC only.
        "full": use fMRIprep output `~desc-smoothAROMAnonaggr_bold.nii.gz` .

    demean : boolean, optional
        If True, the confounds are standardized to a zero mean (over time).
        This step is critical if the confounds are regressed out of time series
        using nilearn with no or zscore standardization, but should be turned off
        with "spc" normalization.


    Attributes
    ----------
    `confounds_` : pandas.DataFrame
        The confounds loaded using the specified model. The columns of the dataframe
        contains the labels.

    `sample_mask_` : list of int
        The index of the niimgs along time/fourth dimension.
        This list includes indices for valid volumes for subsequent analysis.
        This attribute should be passed to parameter `sample_mask` of nilearn.NiftiMasker.
        Volumnes are removed if flagges as following:
            - Non-steady-state volumes (if present)
            - Motion outliers detected by scrubbing

    Notes
    -----
    The predefined strategies implemented in this class are
    adapted from (Ciric et al. 2017). Band-pass filter is replaced
    by high-pass filter. Low-pass filters can be implemented, e.g., through
    nilearn maskers. Scrubbing is implemented by introducing regressors in the
    confounds, rather than eliminating time points. Other aspects of the
    preprocessing listed in Ciric et al. (2017) are controlled through fMRIprep,
    e.g. distortion correction.
