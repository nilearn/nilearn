def _random_walker(data, labels, beta=130, tol=1.e-3, copy=True, spacing=None):
    """Random walker algorithm for segmentation from markers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like
        Image to be segmented in phases. Data spacing is assumed isotropic unless
        the `spacing` keyword argument is used.

    labels : array of ints, of same shape as `data` without channels dimension
        Array of seed markers labeled with different positive integers
        for different phases. Zero-labeled pixels are unlabeled pixels.
        Negative labels correspond to inactive pixels that are not taken
        into account (they are removed from the graph). If labels are not
        consecutive integers, the labels array will be transformed so that
        labels are consecutive.

    beta : float, optional
        Penalization coefficient for the random walker motion
        (the greater `beta`, the more difficult the diffusion).
        Default=130.

    tol : float, optional
        Tolerance to achieve when solving the linear system, in
        cg' mode. Default=1e-3.

    copy : bool, optional
        If copy is False, the `labels` array will be overwritten with
        the result of the segmentation. Use copy=False if you want to
        save on memory. Default=True.

    spacing : iterable of floats, optional
        Spacing between voxels in each spatial dimension. If `None`, then
        the spacing between pixels/voxels in each dimension is assumed 1.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        An array of ints of same shape as `data`, in which each pixel has
        been labeled according to the marker that reached the pixel first
        by anisotropic diffusion.

    Notes
    -----
    The `spacing` argument is specifically for anisotropic datasets, where
    data points are spaced differently in one or more spatial dimensions.
    Anisotropic data is commonly encountered in medical imaging.

    The algorithm was first proposed in [1]_.

    The algorithm solves the diffusion equation at infinite times for
    sources placed on markers of each phase in turn. A pixel is labeled with
    the phase that has the greatest probability to diffuse first to the pixel.

    The diffusion equation is solved by minimizing x.T L x for each phase,
    where L is the Laplacian of the weighted graph of the image, and x is
    the probability that a marker of the given phase arrives first at a pixel
    by diffusion (x=1 on markers of the phase, x=0 on the other markers, and
    the other coefficients are looked for). Each pixel is attributed the label
    for which it has a maximal value of x. The Laplacian L of the image
    is defined as:

       - L_ii = d_i, the number of neighbors of pixel i (the degree of i)
       - L_ij = -w_ij if i and j are adjacent pixels

    The weight w_ij is a decreasing function of the norm of the local gradient.
    This ensures that diffusion is easier between pixels of similar values.

    When the Laplacian is decomposed into blocks of marked and unmarked
    pixels::

        L = M B.T
            B A

    with first indices corresponding to marked pixels, and then to unmarked
    pixels, minimizing x.T L x for one phase amount to solving::

        A x = - B x_m

    where x_m = 1 on markers of the given phase, and 0 on other markers.
    This linear system is solved in the algorithm using a direct method for
    small images, and an iterative method for larger images.
