# hrf_model

hrf_model : :obj:`str`, function, :obj:`list` of functions, or None

    implemented in Nilearn.
    Valid names are:

    - ``"spm"``:
      This is the :term:`HRF` model used in :term:`SPM`.
      See :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.spm_hrf`.

    - ``"spm + derivative"``:
      SPM model plus its time derivative.
      This gives 2 regressors.
      See :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.spm_hrf`, and
      :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.spm_time_derivative`.

    - ``"spm + derivative + dispersion"``:
      Same as above plus dispersion derivative.
      This gives 3 regressors.
      See :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.spm_hrf`,
      :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.spm_time_derivative`,
      and :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.spm_dispersion_derivative`.

    - ``"glover"``:
      This corresponds to the Glover :term:`HRF`.
      See :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.glover_hrf`.

    - ``"glover + derivative"``:
      The Glover :term:`HRF` + time derivative.
      This gives 2 regressors.
      See :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.glover_hrf`, and
      :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.glover_time_derivative`.

    - ``"glover"+ derivative + dispersion"``:
      Same as above plus dispersion derivative.
      This gives 3 regressors.
      See :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.glover_hrf`,
      :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.glover_time_derivative`, and
      :func:`~nilearn.glm.first_level.glover_dispersion_derivative`.

    - ``"fir"``:
      Finite impulse response basis.
      This is a set of delayed dirac models.

    It can also be a custom model.
    In this case, a function should be provided for each regressor.
    Each function should behave as the other models implemented within Nilearn.
    That is, it should take both ``t_r`` and ``oversampling`` as inputs
    and return a sample numpy array of appropriate shape.

    .. note::

        It is expected that ``"spm"`` standard and ``"glover"`` models
        would not yield large differences in most cases.

    .. note::

        In case of ``"glover"`` and ``"spm"`` models,
        the derived regressors are orthogonalized
        with respect to the main one.
