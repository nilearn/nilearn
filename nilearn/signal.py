           identical (i.e. signals.shape[0] == confounds.shape[0]).

           signal, as if all were in the same array.

       t_r: float
           Repetition time, in second (sampling period).

       low_pass, high_pass: float
           Respectively low and high cutoff frequencies, in Hertz.

       detrend: bool
           If detrending should be applied on timeseries (before
           confound removal)
