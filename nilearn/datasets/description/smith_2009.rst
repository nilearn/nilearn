Smith 2009 atlas
================

Access
------
See :func:`nilearn.datasets.fetch_atlas_smith_2009`.

Notes
-----
This atlas provides spatial maps of the major brain networks
during task-constrained brain activity
and task-unconstrained (resting) brain activity.

Those were derived from 6 minutes of :term:`resting-state` time series
from 36 subjects as well as from the from the smoothed task activity coordinates
of healthy subjects stored in the BrainMap database.

See :footcite:t:`Smith2009b` and :footcite:t:`Laird2011`.
