Miyawaki 2008


Notes
-----
Collection of result images from MVPA investigation of the human visual systems.

This fMRI study reconstructed visual images by combining local
image bases of multiple scales. Their contrasts were independently
decoded from fMRI activity by selecting important voxels and
capitalizing on their correlation structure.

Content
-------
    :'label': Paths to text files containing session and target data
    :'func': Paths to nifti files with BOLD data
    :'mask': Path to general mask nifti that defines target volume in visual cortex
    :'mask_roi': List of paths to images with specific data ('RH' for right hemisphere, 'LH' for left hemisphere, 'Vxxx' denote visual areas)
