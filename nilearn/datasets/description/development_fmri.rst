The movie watching based brain development dataset (fMRI)


Notes
-----
This functional MRI dataset is used for teaching how to use
machine learning to predict age from naturalistic stimuli (movie)
watching with Nilearn.

The dataset consists of 50 children (ages 3-13) and 33 young adults (ages
18-39). This dataset can be used to try to predict who are adults and
who are children.

The data is downsampled to 4mm resolution for convenience. The original
data is downloaded from OpenNeuro.

For full information about pre-processing steps on raw-fMRI data, have a look
