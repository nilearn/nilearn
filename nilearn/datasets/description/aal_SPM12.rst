AAL atlas
=========

Access
------
See :func:`nilearn.datasets.fetch_atlas_aal`.

Notes
-----
This atlas is the result of an automated anatomical :term:`parcellation`
of the spatially normalized single-subject high-resolution T1 volume
provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
(D. L. Collins et al., 1998, Trans. Med. Imag. 17, 463-468, PubMed).

Using this :term:`parcellation` method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling
of functional studies are proposed:
(1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates,
(2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and
(3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster.

For more information on this atlas,

and :footcite:t:`Tzourio-Mazoyer2002`.
