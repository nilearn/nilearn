ICBM 152 Atlas


Notes
-----
References atlases intended for spatial normalization, registration, and
segmentation of MRI data. These atlases were generated from large ensembles
of MRI data in an unbiased fashion. MRI data from templates are derived from
"a truly normal, well characterized population."
