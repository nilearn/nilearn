SPM auditory dataset
====================

Access

See :func:`nilearn.datasets.fetch_spm_auditory`.

Notes
-----
These whole brain BOLD/EPI images were acquired on a modified 2T Siemens MAGNETOM Vision system.
Each acquisition consisted of 64 contiguous slices (64x64x64 3mm x 3mm x 3mm voxels).
Acquisition took 6.05 seconds, with the scan to scan repeat time (RT) set arbitrarily to 7 seconds.

96 acquisitions were made (RT= 7 seconds), in blocks of 6, giving 16 blocks of 42 seconds.
The condition for successive blocks alternated between rest and auditory stimulation,
starting with rest.

Auditory stimulation was bi-syllabic words presented binaurally at a rate of 60 per minute.

A structural image was also acquired.

This experiment was conducted by Geriant Rees
under the direction of Karl Friston and the FIL methods group.
