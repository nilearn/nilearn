Milham 2009 Results


Notes
-----
Data from a comprehensive resting-state reliability study. Resting scans are
derived from 26 participants at 3 different time points. Specifically,
intersession (>5 months apart), intrasession (<1 h apart), and multiscan
(across all 3 scans) reliability and consistency for both region-of-interest
and voxel-wise analyses have been studied.
