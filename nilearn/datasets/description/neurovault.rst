NeuroVault

Notes
-----
NeuroVault contains collections of statistical maps of the human brain.
Such maps are acquired by scientists all around the world using brain imaging
techniques such as MRI or PET in a combined effort to map the functions and
structures of the brain. These include threshholded and unthreshholded statistical
maps.

Collections represent images with some relationship to each other.
All data should be transformed into MNI space.
