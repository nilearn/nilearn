Yeo 2011 atlas
==============

Access
------
See :func:`nilearn.datasets.fetch_atlas_yeo_2011`.

Notes
-----
This atlas provides a labeling of some cortical voxels in the MNI152
space.

Four versions of the atlas are available, according to the cortical
model (thick or thin cortical surface) and to the number of regions
considered (7 or 17).

For more information on this dataset's structure,
see :footcite:t:`CorticalParcellation_Yeo2011`,
and :footcite:t:`Yeo2011`.
