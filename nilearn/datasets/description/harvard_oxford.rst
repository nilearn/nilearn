Harvard Oxford atlas

See :func:`nilearn.datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford`.

Notes
-----
Probabilistic atlases covering 48 cortical and 21 subcortical structural areas,
derived from structural data and segmentations kindly
provided by the Harvard Center for Morphometric Analysis.

T1-weighted images of 21 healthy male and 16 healthy female subjects (ages 18-50)
were individually segmented by the CMA using semi-automated tools developed in-house.
The T1-weighted images were affine-registered to MNI152 space using FLIRT (FSL),
and the transforms then applied to the individual labels.
Finally, these were combined across subjects to form population probability maps for each label.
