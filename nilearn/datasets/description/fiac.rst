Notes
-----
Analysis from the Functional Imaging Analysis Contest (FIAC).

This is a block design experiment with a 2 X 2 experimental design
with the following factors:

- ``Sentence`` with 2 levels: Same (SSt) vs Different (DSt)
- ``Speaker``  with 2 levels: Same (SSp) vs Different (DSp)

giving the 4 following conditions:

- Same Sentence-Same Speaker (SStSSp)
- Same Sentence-Different Speakers (SStDSp)
- Different Sentences-Same Speaker (DStSSp)
- Different Sentences-Different Speakers (DStDSp)

The design also included a 5th condition
containing the first sentence pooled across all conditions.

For more details on the data, please see experiment 2 :footcite:t:`dehaene2006functional`.
