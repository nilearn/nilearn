Craddock 2012


Notes
-----
Collection of regions of interest (ROI) that have been generated from applying
spatially constrained clustering on resting-state data.

Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological trade-offs
as well as determine an adequate number of clusters. The proposed functional
and random parcellations perform equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated.
The online release also contains the scripts to derive these ROI atlases
by using spatially constrained Ncut spectral clustering.
