See :func:`nilearn.datasets.fetch_atlas_juelich`.

Notes
-----
The Julich-Brain cytoarchitectonic atlas presents cytoarchitectonic maps in several coordinate spaces,
such as :term:`MNI` colin27, MNI152, and freesurfer.
These maps originate from peer-reviewed probability maps that define
both cortical and subcortical brain regions.
Notably, these probability maps account for the brain's inter-individual variability
by analyzing data from multiple post-mortem samples.
For a whole-brain parcellation, the available probability maps are combined
into a maximum probability map by considering for each :term:`voxel` the probability of all cytoarchitectonic brain regions,
and determining the most probable assignment.
