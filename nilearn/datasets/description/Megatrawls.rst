MegaTrawls Network Matrices HCP


Notes
-----
Contains network matrices data of two types, full correlation and partial
correlation which were estimated using each subject specific timeseries
signals extracted from group of ICA nodes or parcellations. In total,
461 functional connectivity datasets were used to obtain these matrices
and is part of HCP Megatrawls release.

The number of nodes available for download are 25, 50, 100, 200, 300
with combination of two variants of timeseries extraction methods,
multiple spatial regression (ts2) and eigen regression (ts3).

These matrices can be used to predict the relationships between subjects
functional connectivity datasets and their behavioural measures. Both can be
downloaded from HCP connectome website under conditions. See disclaimer below.
