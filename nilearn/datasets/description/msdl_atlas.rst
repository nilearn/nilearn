MSDL atlas


Notes
-----
Result maps of sparse dictionary learning based on resting-state data.

This can be understand as a variant of ICA based on the assumption
of sparsity rather than independence.


Content
-------
    :'maps': Nifti images with the (probabilistic) region definitions
    :'labels': CSV file specifying the label information
