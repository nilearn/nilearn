"""
Smoothing an image
===================

Here we smooth a mean EPI image and plot the result

As we vary the smoothing FWHM, note how we decrease the amount of noise,
but also loose spatial details. In general, the best amount of smoothing
for a given analysis depends on the spatial extent of the effects that
are expected.
