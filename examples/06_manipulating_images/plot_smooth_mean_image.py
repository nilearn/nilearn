"""
Smoothing an image
==================

Here we smooth a mean :term:`EPI` image and plot the result

As we vary the smoothing :term:`FWHM`,
note how we decrease the amount of noise, but also lose spatial details.
In general, the best amount of smoothing for a given analysis
depends on the spatial extent of the effects that are expected.

We then show how to smooth a SurfaceImage.
