Example of surface-based first-level analysis
=============================================

.. warning::

    This example is adapted from
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_04_glm_first_level_plot_localizer_surface_analysis.py`. # noqa
    to show how to use the new tentative API for surface images in nilearn.

    This functionality is provided
    by the :mod:`nilearn.experimental.surface` module.

    It is still incomplete and subject to change without a deprecation cycle.

    Please participate in the discussion on GitHub!

A full step-by-step example of fitting a :term:`GLM`
to experimental data sampled on the cortical surface
and visualizing the results.

More specifically:

1. A sequence of :term:`fMRI` volumes is loaded.
2. :term:`fMRI` data are projected onto a reference cortical surface
   (the FreeSurfer template, fsaverage).
3. A :term:`GLM` is applied to the dataset
   (effect/covariance, then contrast estimation).

The result of the analysis are statistical maps that are defined
on the brain mesh.
We display them using Nilearn capabilities.

The projection of :term:`fMRI` data onto a given brain :term:`mesh` requires
that both are initially defined in the same space.

* The functional data should be coregistered to the anatomy
  from which the mesh was obtained.

* Another possibility, used here, is to project
  the normalized :term:`fMRI` data to an :term:`MNI`-coregistered mesh,
  such as fsaverage.

The advantage of this second approach is that it makes it easy to run
second-level analyses on the surface.
On the other hand, it is obviously less accurate
than using a subject-tailored mesh.
