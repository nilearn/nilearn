"""
Simple example of two-runs fMRI surface based model fitting
===========================================================

.. warning::

    This is an adaption of
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_04_glm_first_level_plot_two_runs_model.py`
    to use make it work with the new experimental surface API.

Here, we will go through a full step-by-step example
of fitting a surface based GLM
to experimental data and visualizing the results.
This is done on two runs of one subject of the FIAC dataset.

For more details on the data,
please see experiment 2 in :footcite:t:`Dehaene2006`.

Here are the steps we will go through:

1. Set up the GLM
2. Compute a range of contrasts across both runs
3. Generate a report

Technically, this example shows how to handle two runs
that contain the same experimental conditions.
The model directly returns a fixed effect
of the statistics across the two runs.
