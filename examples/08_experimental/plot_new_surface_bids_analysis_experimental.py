"""
Surface-based dataset first and second level analysis of a dataset
==================================================================

.. warning::

    This example is adapted from
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_07_advanced_plot_surface_bids_analysis.py`. # noqa
    to show how to use the new tentative API for surface images in nilearn.

    This functionality is provided
    by the :mod:`nilearn.experimental.surface` module.

    It is still incomplete and subject to change without a deprecation cycle.

    Please participate in the discussion on GitHub!

Full step-by-step example of fitting a :term:`GLM`
(first and second level analysis) in a 10-subjects dataset
and visualizing the results.

More specifically:

#. Download an :term:`fMRI` :term:`BIDS` dataset
   with two language conditions to contrast.

#. Project the data to a standard mesh, fsaverage5,
   also known as the Freesurfer template :term:`mesh`
   downsampled to about 10k nodes per hemisphere.

#. Run the first level model objects.

#. Fit a second level model on the fitted first level models.

Notice that in this case the preprocessed :term:`bold<BOLD>` images
were already normalized to the same :term:`MNI` space.

# Fetch example :term:`BIDS` dataset
# ----------------------------------
# We download a simplified :term:`BIDS` dataset
# made available for illustrative purposes.
# It contains only the necessary information
# to run a statistical analysis using Nilearn.
# The raw data subject folders only contain bold.json and events.tsv files,
# while the derivatives folder includes the preprocessed files preproc.nii
# and the confounds.tsv files.

# Here is the location of the dataset on disk.

# %%
# Obtain automatically FirstLevelModel objects and fit arguments
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# From the dataset directory we automatically obtain
# the FirstLevelModel objects
# with their subject_id filled from the :term:`BIDS` dataset.
# Moreover, we obtain for each model
# a dictionary with run_imgs, events and confounder regressors
# since in this case a confounds.tsv file is available
# in the :term:`BIDS` dataset.
# To get the first level models we only have to specify the dataset directory
# and the task_label as specified in the file names.

# %%
# Project :term:`fMRI` data to the surface and compute GLM and contrasts

# The projection function simply takes the :term:`fMRI` data and the mesh.
