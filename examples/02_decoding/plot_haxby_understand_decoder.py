"""Understanding :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder`
==================================================

Nilearn's :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` object is a composite estimator
that does several things under the hood and can hence be a bit difficult to
understand at first.

This example aims to provide a clear understanding of the
:class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` object by demonstrating these steps via a
Scikit-Learn pipeline.

We will use the :footcite:t:`Haxby2001` dataset where the participants were
shown images of 8 different types as described in the
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_02_decoding_plot_haxby_anova_svm.py` example.
We will train a classifier to predict the label of the object in the stimulus
image based on the subject's fMRI data from the Ventral Temporal cortex.
"""

# %%
# Load the Haxby dataset
# ----------------------
from nilearn import datasets

# By default 2nd subject data will be fetched on which we run our analysis
haxby_dataset = datasets.fetch_haxby()
fmri_img = haxby_dataset.func[0]
# Pick the mask that we will use to extract the data from Ventral Temporal
# cortex
mask_vt = haxby_dataset.mask_vt[0]

# Load the behavioral data
import pandas as pd

from nilearn.image import index_img

behavioral_data = pd.read_csv(haxby_dataset.session_target[0], sep=" ")
labels = behavioral_data["labels"]
# Keep the trials corresponding to all the labels except the ``rest`` ones
labels_mask = labels != "rest"
y = labels[labels_mask]
y = y.to_numpy()

# Load run information
run = behavioral_data["chunks"][labels_mask]
run = run.to_numpy()

# Also keep the fmri data corresponding to these labels
fmri_img = index_img(fmri_img, labels_mask)

# Overview of the input data
import numpy as np

n_labels = len(np.unique(y))

print(f"{n_labels} labels to predict (y): {np.unique(y)}")
print(f"fMRI data shape (X): {fmri_img.shape}")
print(f"Runs (groups): {np.unique(run)}")

# %%
# Preprocessing
# -------------
#
# As we can see, the fMRI data is a 4D image with shape (40, 64, 64, 864).
# Here 40x64x64 are the dimensions of the 3D brain image and 864 is the number
# of brain volumes acquired while visual stimuli were presented, each
# corresponding to one of the 8 labels we selected above.
#
# :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` can convert this 4D image to a 2D numpy
# array where each row corresponds to a trial and each column corresponds to a
# voxel. In addition, it can also do several other things like masking,
# smoothing, standardizing the data etc. depending on your requirements.
#
# Under the hood, :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` uses
# :class:`nilearn.maskers.NiftiMasker` to do all these operations. So here we
# will demonstrate this by directly using the
# :class:`nilearn.maskers.NiftiMasker`. Specifically, we will use it to:
#
# 1. only keep the data from the Ventral Temporal cortex by providing the
# mask image (in :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` this is done by
# providing the mask image in the ``mask`` parameter).
#
# 2. standardize the data by z-scoring it such that the data is scaled to
# have zero mean and unit variance across trials (in
# :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` this is done by setting the ``standardize``
# parameter to ``"zscore_sample"``).

from nilearn.maskers import NiftiMasker

masker = NiftiMasker(mask_img=mask_vt, standardize="zscore_sample")

# %%
# Convert the multi-class labels to binary labels
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# The :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` converts multi-class classification
# problem to N one-vs-others binary classification problems by default (where N
# is the number of unique labels)
#
# The advantage of this approach is its interpretability. Once we are done with
# training and cross-validating, we will have N area-under receiver operating
# characteristic curve (AU-:term:`ROC`) scores, one for each
# label. This will give us an insight into which labels (and the corresponding
# cognitive domains) are easier to predict and are hence well differentiated
# relative to the others in the brain.
#
# In addition, we will also have access to the classifier coefficients for each
# label. These can be further used to understand the importance of each voxel
# for each corresponding cognitive domain.
#
# In this example we have N = 8 unique labels and we will use Scikit-Learn's
# :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.LabelBinarizer` to do this conversion.

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer

label_binarizer = LabelBinarizer(pos_label=1, neg_label=-1)
y_binary = label_binarizer.fit_transform(y)

# %%
# Let's plot the labels to understand the conversion
from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# create a copy of y_binary and manipulate it just for plotting
y_binary_ = y_binary.copy()
for col in range(y_binary_.shape[1]):
    y_binary_[np.where(y_binary_[:, col] == 1), col] = col

fig, (ax_binary, ax_multi) = plt.subplots(
    2, gridspec_kw={"height_ratios": [10, 1.5]}, figsize=(12, 2)
)
cmap = ListedColormap(["white"] + list(plt.cm.tab10.colors)[0:n_labels])
binary_plt = ax_binary.imshow(
    y_binary_.T,
    aspect="auto",
    cmap=cmap,
    interpolation="nearest",
    origin="lower",
)
ax_binary.set_xticks([])
ax_binary.set_yticks([])
ax_binary.set_ylabel("One-vs-Others")

# encode the original labels for plotting
label_multi = LabelEncoder()
y_multi = label_multi.fit_transform(y)
y_multi = y_multi.reshape(1, -1)
cmap = ListedColormap(list(plt.cm.tab10.colors)[0:n_labels])
multi_plt = ax_multi.imshow(
    y_multi,
    aspect="auto",
    interpolation="nearest",
    cmap=cmap,
)
ax_multi.set_yticks([])
ax_multi.set_xlabel("Original trial sequence")
cbar = fig.colorbar(multi_plt, ax=[ax_binary, ax_multi])
cbar.set_ticks(np.arange(1 + len(label_multi.classes_)))
cbar.set_ticklabels([*label_multi.classes_, "all others"])

plt.show()

# %%
# So at the bottom we have the original presentation sequence of the selected
# trials and at the top we have the labels in the one-vs-others format.
#
# Each row corresponds to a one-vs-others binary classification problem.
# For example, the first row from the bottom corresponds to the binary
# classification problem of predicting the label "bottle" vs. all other labels
# and so on. Later we will train a classifier for each row and calculate the
# AU-ROC score for each row.

# %%
# Feature selection
# -----------------
#
# After preprocessing the provided fMRI data, the
# :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` performs a univariate feature selection on
# the voxels of the brain volume. It uses Scikit-Learn's
# :class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SelectPercentile` with
# :func:`~sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif` to calculate ANOVA F-scores for
# each voxel and to only keep the ones that have highest 20 percentile scores,
# by default. This selection threshold can be changed using the
# ``screening_percentile`` parameter.
#
# These 20 percentile voxels are with respect to the volume of the standard
# MNI152 brain template. Furthermore, if the provided mask image has less
# voxels than the selected percentile, all voxels in the mask are used.
# This is done via the ``adjust_screening_percentile`` function.
#
# Also note that these top 20 percentile voxels are selected based on training
# set and then these selected voxels are picked for the test set too for each
# train-test split.
#
# So let's define a feature selector for later use in our Scikit-Learn decoding
# pipeline.

from nilearn._utils.param_validation import adjust_screening_percentile
from nilearn.image import load_img

mask_vt_loaded = load_img(mask_vt)
screen_percent = adjust_screening_percentile(20, mask_vt_loaded)
print(f"Adjusted screening percentile: {screen_percent}")

from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectPercentile, f_classif

feature_selector = SelectPercentile(f_classif, percentile=int(screen_percent))

# %%
# Hyperparameter optimization
# ---------------------------
#
# The :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` also performs hyperparameter tuning.
# How this is done depends on the estimator used.
#
# For the support vector classifiers (known as SVC, and used by setting
# ``estimator="svc"`` or ``"svc_l1"`` or ``"svc_l2"``), the score from the
# best performing regularization hyperparameter (``C``) for each train-test
# split is picked.
#
# For all classifiers other than SVC, the hyperparameter tuning is done using
# the ``<estimator_name>CV`` classes from Scikit-Learn. This essentially means
# that the hyperparameters are optimized using an internal cross-validation on
# the training data.
#
# In addition, the parameter grids that are used for hyperparameter tuning
# by :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` are also different from the default
# Scikit-Learn parameter grids for the corresponding ``<estimator_name>CV``
# objects.
#
# For simplicity, let's use Scikit-Learn's
# :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` with custom parameter
# grid (via ``Cs`` parameter) as used in Nilearn's
# :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder`.

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV

classifier = LogisticRegressionCV(
    penalty="l2",
    solver="liblinear",
    Cs=np.geomspace(1e-3, 1e4, 8),
    refit=True,
)

# %%
# Train and cross-validate via an Scikit-Learn pipeline
# -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Now let's put all the pieces together to train and cross-validate. The
# :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` uses a leave-one-group-out
# cross-validation scheme by default in cases where groups are defined. In our
# example a group is a run, so we will use Scikit-Learn's
# :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.LeaveOneGroupOut`

from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
from sklearn.model_selection import LeaveOneGroupOut

logo_cv = LeaveOneGroupOut()

# Transform fMRI data into a 2D numpy array and standardize it with the masker
X = masker.fit_transform(fmri_img)
print(f"fMRI data shape after masking: {X.shape}")
# So now we have a 2D numpy array of shape (864, 464) where each row
# corresponds to a trial and each column corresponds to a feature
# (voxel in the Ventral Temporal cortex).

# Loop over each CV split and each class vs. rest binary classification
# problems (number of classification problems = n_labels)
scores_sklearn = []
for klass in range(n_labels):
    for train, test in logo_cv.split(X, y, groups=run):
        # separate train and test events in the data
        X_train, X_test = X[train], X[test]
        # separate labels for train and test events for a given class vs. rest
        # problem
        y_train, y_test = y_binary[train, klass], y_binary[test, klass]

        # select the voxels by fitting feature selector on training data
        X_train = feature_selector.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
        # pick the same voxels in the test data
        X_test = feature_selector.transform(X_test)

        # fit the classifier on the training data
        classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
        # predict the labels on the test data
        pred = classifier.predict_proba(X_test)

        # calculate the ROC AUC score
        score = roc_auc_score(y_test, pred[:, 1])
        scores_sklearn.append(score)

# %%
# Decode via the :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder`
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# All these steps can be done in a few lines and made faster via parallel
# processing using the ``n_jobs`` parameter in
# :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder`.

from nilearn.decoding import Decoder

decoder = Decoder(
    estimator="logistic_l2",
    mask=mask_vt,
    standardize="zscore_sample",
    n_jobs=n_labels,
    cv=logo_cv,
    screening_percentile=20,
    scoring="roc_auc_ovr",
)
decoder.fit(fmri_img, y, groups=run)
scores_nilearn = np.concatenate(list(decoder.cv_scores_.values()))

# %%
# Compare the results
# -------------------
#
# Let's compare the results from the Scikit-Learn pipeline and the Nilearn
# decoder.

print("Nilearn mean AU-ROC score", np.mean(scores_nilearn))
print("Scikit-Learn mean AU-ROC score", np.mean(scores_sklearn))

# %%
# As we can see, the mean AU-ROC scores from the Scikit-Learn pipeline and
# Nilearn's :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` are identical.
#
# The advantage of using Nilearn's :class:`nilearn.decoding.Decoder` is
# that it does all these steps under the hood and provides a simple interface
# to train, cross-validate and predict on new data, while also parallelizing
# the computations to make the cross-validation faster. It also organises the
# results in a structured way that can be easily accessed and analysed.
