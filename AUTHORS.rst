.. _citing:

Citing nilearn
--------------

There is no paper published yet about nilearn. We are waiting for the
package to mature a bit. However, the patterns underlying the package
have been described in: `Machine learning for neuroimaging with
scikit-learn
<http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2014.00014/abstract>`_.

We suggest that you read and cite the paper. Thank you.


Citing scikit-learn
-------------------

A huge amount of work goes into scikit-learn, upon which nilearn relies heavily.
Researchers who invest their time in developing and maintaining the package
deserve recognition with citations.
In addition, the Parietal team needs citations to the paper in order to
justify paying a software engineer on the project.
To guarantee the future of the toolkit, if you use it, please cite it.

See the scikit-learn documentation on `how to cite
