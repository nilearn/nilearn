.. _citing:

Citing nilearn
--------------

There is no paper published yet about nilearn. We are waiting for the
package to mature a bit. However, the patterns underlying the package
have been described in: `Machine learning for neuroimaging with
scikit-learn
<http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2014.00014/abstract>`_.

We suggest that you read and cite the paper. Thank you.


Citing scikit-learn
-------------------

A huge amount of work goes into :sklearn:`scikit-learn <>`,
upon which nilearn relies heavily.
Researchers who invest their time in developing and maintaining the package
deserve recognition with citations.
In addition, the :inria:`INRIA MIND Project Team <mind>` needs citations
to the paper in order to justify paying a software engineer on the project.
To guarantee the future of the toolkit, if you use it, please cite it.

See the scikit-learn documentation on
:sklearn:`how to cite <about.html#citing-scikit-learn>`.
