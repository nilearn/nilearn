Pull Requests
---------------

We welcome pull requests from all community members.
We follow the same conventions as scikit-learn. You can find the recommended process to submit code in the
`scikit-learn guide to contributing code
<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#contributing-code>`_.

.. _git_repo:

Retrieving the latest code
---------------------------

We use `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ for version control and
`GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ for hosting our main repository. If you are
new on GitHub and don't know how to work with it, please first
have a look at `this <https://try.github.io/>`_ to get the basics.


You can check out the latest sources with the command::

    git clone git://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.git

or if you have write privileges::

    git clone git@github.com:nilearn/nilearn.git
    
Installing the latest code
---------------------------

In order to ensure that any code changes are reflected in your installation, navigate to your cloned Nilearn base directory and install using the following command::

    pip install -e .


Coding guidelines
------------------

Nilearn follows the coding conventions used by scikit-learn. `Please read them
<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#coding-guidelines>`_
before you start implementing your changes.

Contributing to the documentation
-------------------------------------------------

To build our documentation, we are using `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html>`_ for the main documentation and `sphinx-gallery <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html>`_ for the example tutorials.
If you want to make changes to the example tutorials, please do the following :

1. First, ensure that you have installed sphinx and sphinx-gallery. You can install the requirements using ``nilearn/requirements-build-docs.txt``.
2. Fork the Nilearn repository and clone your fork.
3. Then go to ``nilearn/examples``
4. Make your changes using `reStructuredText files <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/2.0/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_
5. You can now go to `nilearn/doc` and build the examples locally::

      make html-strict

   or, if you do not have make install (for instance under Windows)::

      python3 -m sphinx -b html -d _build/doctrees . _build/html

6. Visually review the output in ``nilearn/doc/_build/html/auto_examples/``. If all looks well and there were no errors, commit and push the changes.
7. You can now open a Pull Request from Nilearn's Pull Request page.

For more details about the Fork Clone Push worksflow, read here <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>_


TIPS : To reduce building time, we suggest you to use the ``filename_pattern`` to build just one specific file::

      python3 -m sphinx -D sphinx_gallery_conf.filename_pattern=plot_decoding_tutorial.py -b html -d _build/doctrees . _build/html
