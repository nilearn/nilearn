# Workflow to check the time taken to run tests and build the documentation.
#
# Pings Github API to collect information about:
#
# - how long each run of the test suite lasted,
# - how long the build of the doc lasted.
#
# Plots the results and saves it as an artifact to download and manually inspect
# to see if there is a trend in tests or doc build taking longer.
