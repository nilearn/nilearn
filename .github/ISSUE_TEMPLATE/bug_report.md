Hi! 
If you have: 
 -1 Questions about how to use Nilearn or 
 -2 Need analysis suggestions & recommendations?

A bunch of fMRI researchers hang out at Neurostars (http://neurostars.org/). 
Post those questions there. 
Add the tag `nilearn`

Posting them here makes life more complicated for the Nilearn developers.

<!--
