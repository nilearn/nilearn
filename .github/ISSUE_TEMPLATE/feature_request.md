Hi! 
If you have: 
 -1 Questions about how to use Nilearn or 
 -2 Need analysis suggestions & recommendations?

A bunch of fMRI researchers hang out at Neurostars (http://neurostars.org/). 
Post those questions there. 
Add the tag `nilearn` (we get an email from Neurostars if you do).

Posting them here makes life more complicated for the Nilearn developers.

<!-- 
For the Feature Request,
Include the following:
------------------------
What would you like changed/added and why?
What would be the benefit? Does the change make something easier to use?
Clarifies something?
If it is a new feature, what is the benefit? 
-->
