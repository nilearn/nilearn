Parcellating the brain in regions
==================================

.. topic:: **Page summary**

    This page demonstrates how clustering can be used to parcellate the
    brain into homogeneous regions from resting-state time series.


A resting-state dataset
========================

.. currentmodule:: nilearn.datasets

Here, we use a `resting-state <http://www.nitrc.org/projects/nyu_trt/>`_ 
dataset from test-retest study performed at NYU. Details on the data 
can be found in the documentation for the downloading function 
:func:`fetch_nyu_rest`.

Preprocessing: loading and masking
==================================

We fetch the data from Internet and load it with a dedicated function
(see :ref:`loading_data`):

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.py
    :start-after: ### Load nyu_rest dataset #####################################################
    :end-before: ### Ward ######################################################################

No mask is given with the data so we let the masker compute one.
The result is a niimg from which we extract a numpy array that is
used to mask our original images.

Applying Ward clustering
==========================

**Compute a connectivity matrix**
Before applying Ward's method, we compute a spatial neighborhood matrix,
aka connectivity matrix. This is useful to constrain clusters to form
contiguous parcels (see `the scikit-learn documentation
<http://scikit-learn.org/stable//modules/clustering.html#adding-connectivity-constraints>`_)

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.py
    :start-after: # Compute connectivity matrix: which voxel is connected to which
    :end-before: # Computing the ward for the first time, this is long...

**Ward clustering principle**
Ward's algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm: it
recursively merges voxels, then clusters that have similar signal
(parameters, measurements or time courses).

**Caching** In practice the implementation of Ward clustering first
computes a tree of possible merges, and then, given a requested number of
clusters, breaks apart the tree at the right level.

As the tree is independent of the number of clusters, we can rely on caching to speed things up when varying the
number of clusters. In Wards clustering,
the *memory* parameter is used to cache the computed component tree. You
can give it either a *joblib.Memory* instance or the name of a directory
used for caching.

Running the Ward algorithm
---------------------------

Here we simply launch Ward's algorithm to find 1000 clusters and we time it.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.py
    :start-after: # Computing the ward for the first time, this is long...
    :end-before: # Compute the ward with more clusters, should be faster

This runs in about 10 seconds (depending on your computer configuration). Now,
we are not satisfied of the result and we want to cluster the picture in 2000
elements.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.py
    :start-after: # Compute the ward with more clusters, should be faster
    :end-before: ### Show result ############################################################### 

Now that the component tree has been computed, computation is must faster
thanks to caching. You should have the result in less than 1 second.

Post-Processing and visualizing the parcels
============================================

Unmasking
---------

After applying the ward, we must unmask the data. This can be done simply :

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.py
    :start-after: # Unmask data
    :end-before: # Display the labels 

You can see that masked data is filled with -1 values. This is done for the
sake of visualization. In fact, clusters are labeled from 0 to
(n_clusters - 1). By putting every background value to -1, we assure that
they will not mess with the visualization.

Label visualization
--------------------

To visualize the clusters, we assign random colors to each cluster
for the labels visualization.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.py
    :start-after: ### Show result ###############################################################
    :end-before: # Display the original data


.. figure:: ../auto_examples/connectivity/images/plot_rest_clustering_001.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.html
   :align: center
   :scale: 80

Compressed picture
------------------

By transforming a picture in a new one in which the value of each voxel
is the mean value of the cluster it belongs to, we are creating a
compressed version of the original picture. We can obtain this
representation thanks to a two-step procedure :

- call *ward.transform* to obtain the mean value of each cluster (for each
  scan)
- call *ward.inverse_transform* on the previous result to turn it back into
  the masked picture shape

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.py
    :start-after: # Display the original data

.. |left_img| image:: ../auto_examples/connectivity/images/plot_rest_clustering_002.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.html
   :width: 49%

.. |right_img| image:: ../auto_examples/connectivity/images/plot_rest_clustering_003.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.html
   :width: 49%

|left_img| |right_img|

We can see that using only 2000 parcels, the original image is well
approximated.
