Extracting functional brain networks: ICA and related
=====================================================

.. topic:: **Page summary**

   This page demonstrates the use of multi-subject decompositions models
   to extract brain-networks from :term:`fMRI` data in a data-driven way.
   Specifically, we will apply Independent Component Analysis (:term:`ICA`), which
   implements a multivariate random effects model across subjects. We will
   then compare :term:`ICA` to a newer technique, based on dictionary learning.

Multi-subject ICA: CanICA
=========================

Objective
----------
:term:`ICA` is a useful approach for finding independent sources from :term:`fMRI`
images. :term:`ICA` and similar techniques can be therefore used to define
regions or networks that share similar :term:`BOLD` signal across time. The
:term:`CanICA` incorporates information both within-subjects and across subjects
to arrive at consensus components.

.. topic:: **Nilearn data for examples**

   Nilearn provides easy-to-analyze data to explore functional connectivity and resting: the
   `brain development dataset <https://osf.io/5hju4/files/>`_, which
   has been preprocessed using `FMRIPrep and Nilearn <https://osf.io/wjtyq/>`_
   We use nilearn functions to fetch data from Internet and get the
   filenames (:ref:`more on data loading <loading_data>`).


Fitting CanICA model with nilearn
---------------------------------
:class:`CanICA` is a ready-to-use object that can be applied to
multi-subject Nifti data, for instance presented as filenames, and will
perform a multi-subject :term:`ICA` decomposition following the :term:`CanICA` model.
As with every object in nilearn, we give its parameters at construction,
and then fit it on the data. For examples of this process, see
here: :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_03_connectivity_plot_compare_decomposition.py`

Once an :term:`ICA` object has been fit to an :term:`fMRI` dataset, the individual
components can be accessed as a 4D Nifti object using the
``components_img_`` attribute.

Visualizing results
--------------------
We can visualize each component outlined over the brain:

.. figure:: ../auto_examples/03_connectivity/images/sphx_glr_plot_compare_decomposition_001.png
   :align: center
   :target: ../auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_compare_decomposition.html

We can also plot the map for different components separately:

.. note::

   Note that as the :term:`ICA` components are not ordered, the two components
   displayed on your computer might not match those of the documentation. For
   a fair representation, you should display all components and
   investigate which one resemble those displayed above.

Interpreting such components
-----------------------------

:term:`ICA`, and related algorithms, extract patterns that coactivate in the
signal. As a result, it finds functional networks, but also patterns of
non neural activity, ie confounding signals. Both are visible in the
plots of the components.

An alternative to ICA: Dictionary learning
===========================================
Recent work has shown that dictionary learning based techniques outperform
:term:`ICA` in term of stability and constitutes a better first step in a statistical
analysis pipeline.
Dictionary learning in neuro-imaging seeks to extract a few representative
temporal elements along with their sparse spatial loadings, which constitute
good extracted maps.

:class:`DictLearning` is a ready-to-use class with the same interface as
:class:`CanICA`. Sparsity of output map is controlled by a parameter alpha: using
a larger alpha yields sparser maps.

We can fit both estimators to compare them. 4D plotting (using
:func:`nilearn.plotting.plot_prob_atlas`) offers an efficient way to
compare both resulting outputs.

Maps obtained with dictionary learning are often easier to exploit as they are
more contrasted than :term:`ICA` maps, with blobs usually better defined. Typically,
*smoothing can be lower than when doing ICA*.

While dictionary learning computation time is comparable to :term:`CanICA`, obtained
atlases have been shown to outperform :term:`ICA` in a variety of classification tasks.
