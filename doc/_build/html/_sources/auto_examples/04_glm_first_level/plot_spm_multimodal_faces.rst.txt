Single-subject data (two sessions) in native space
==================================================

The example shows the analysis of an SPM dataset studying face perception.  The
analysis is performed in native space. Realignment parameters are provided with
the input images, but those have not been resampled to a common space.

The experimental paradigm is simple, with two conditions; viewing a face image
or a scrambled face image, supposedly with the same low-level statistical
properties, to find face-specific responses.

For details on the data, please see:
Henson, R.N., Goshen-Gottstein, Y., Ganel, T., Otten, L.J., Quayle, A.,
Rugg, M.D. Electrophysiological and haemodynamic correlates of face
perception, recognition and priming. Cereb Cortex. 2003 Jul;13(7):793-805.
http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/13.7.793

This example takes a lot of time because the input are lists of 3D images
sampled in different positions (encoded by different affine functions).

We can specify basic contrasts (to get :term:`beta<Parameter Estimate>`
maps).
We start by specifying canonical contrast that isolate design matrix columns.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-95

.. code-block:: default

    contrast_matrix = np.eye(design_matrix.shape[1])
    basic_contrasts = dict([(column, contrast_matrix[i])
                            for i, column in enumerate(design_matrix.columns)])


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 96-101

We actually want more interesting contrasts. The simplest contrast
just makes the difference between the two main conditions.  We
define the two opposite versions to run one-tailed t-tests.  We also
define the effects of interest contrast, a 2-dimensional contrasts
spanning the two conditions.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 101-109

.. code-block:: default


    contrasts = {
        'faces-scrambled': basic_contrasts['faces'] - basic_contrasts['scrambled'],
        'scrambled-faces': -basic_contrasts['faces'] + basic_contrasts['scrambled'],
        'effects_of_interest': np.vstack((basic_contrasts['faces'],
                                          basic_contrasts['scrambled']))
        }

Fit the GLM for the 2 sessions by specifying a FirstLevelModel and then
fitting it.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 112-117

.. code-block:: default

    from nilearn.glm.first_level import FirstLevelModel
    print('Fitting a GLM')
    fmri_glm = FirstLevelModel()
    fmri_glm = fmri_glm.fit(fmri_img, design_matrices=design_matrices)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 118-120

Now we can compute contrast-related statistical maps (in z-scale), and plot
them.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 120-137

.. code-block:: default

    print('Computing contrasts')
    from nilearn import plotting

    # Iterate on contrasts
    for contrast_id, contrast_val in contrasts.items():
        print("\tcontrast id: %s" % contrast_id)
        # compute the contrasts
        z_map = fmri_glm.compute_contrast(
            contrast_val, output_type='z_score')
        # plot the contrasts as soon as they're generated
        # the display is overlaid on the mean fMRI image
        # a threshold of 3.0 is used, more sophisticated choices are possible
        plotting.plot_stat_map(
            z_map, bg_img=mean_image, threshold=3.0, display_mode='z',
            cut_coords=3, black_bg=True, title=contrast_id)
        plotting.show()

Based on the resulting maps we observe that the analysis results in
wide activity for the 'effects of interest' contrast, showing the
implications of large portions of the visual cortex in the
conditions. By contrast, the differential effect between "faces" and
"scrambled" involves sparser, more anterior and lateral regions. It
also displays some responses in the frontal lobe.
