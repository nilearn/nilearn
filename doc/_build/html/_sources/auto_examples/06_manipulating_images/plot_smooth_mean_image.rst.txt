Smoothing an image
===================

Here we smooth a mean :term:`EPI` image and plot the result

As we vary the smoothing :term:`FWHM`, note how we decrease the amount
of noise, but also lose spatial details. In general, the best amount
of smoothing for a given analysis depends on the spatial extent of the
effects that are expected.
