Difference in meanings between different toolboxes
==================================================

.. topic:: **Page summary**

	* SPM has the same meaning of analysis levels, compared to nilearn's models
		* First-level: analyze across runs
		* Second-level: group-level analysis
	* FSL has a different meaning
		* First-level: analyze one session for one subject
		* Second-level: analyze across sessions for one subject
		* Third-level: group-level analysis
	
These differences can be put in the table below:

Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
====================================

SPM uses the same notation as nilearn for analysis levels, with a note that a session still refers to an imaging session or a run, and within a run there could be multiple conditions (e.g., congruent and incongruent).
In this case, `SPM`_ provided `tutorials`_ and documentation, including `lectures`_, which one could learn to analyze their own fMRI data with the meaning of analysis levels being as follows:

	* `First-level analysis in SPM`_: Analyze across sessions for a subject (i.e., more than one session of one subject)
	* `Second-level analysis in SPM`_: Analyze across several subjects (i.e., more than one subject with one or more sessions per subject). This is also known as **group-level analysis** which test if the average estimate across subjects is statistically significant.

FMRIB Software Library (FSL)
============================

FSL uses a slightly different set of meanings for analysis levels, but with a note that a session still refers to an imaging session or a run.
Specifically, `FEAT`_, FSL software tool for model-based fMRI data analysis, provides GUI to run analysis on imaging data for first-level and higher-level analysis with the `terminology meaning`_ as follows:

  * `First-level analysis in FSL`_: Analyze each session's data by getting the parameter and contrast estimates (i.e., one session of one subject)
  * `Second-level analysis in FSL`_: Analyze across sessions for a subject via averaging the parameter and contrast estimates within each subject (i.e., more than one session of one subject)
  * `Third-level analysis in FSL`_: Analyze across several subjects or group-level analysis on the averaged contrast estimates for all subjects within the group (i.e., more than one subject with one or more sessions per subject)
