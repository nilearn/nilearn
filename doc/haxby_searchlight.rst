Searchlight : finding voxels containing information

Searchlight principle
=====================

Searchlight was introduced in `Information-based functional brain mapping
<http://www.pnas.org/content/103/10/3863>`_, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte,
Rainer Goebel and Peter Bandettini (PNAS 2006) and consists in scanning the
images volume with a *searchlight*. Briefly, a ball of given radius is
scanned across the brain volume and the prediction accuracy of a
classifier trained on the corresponding voxels is measured.

Preprocessing
=============

Loading
-------

As seen in :ref:`previous sections <downloading_data>`, fetching the data
from internet and loading it can be done with the provided functions:

.. literalinclude:: ../plot_haxby_searchlight.py
    :start-after: ### Load Haxby dataset ########################################################
    :end-before: ### Preprocess data ###########################################################

Preparing data
--------------

For this tutorial we need:

- to put X in the form *n_samples* x *n_features*
- compute a mean image for visualisation background

.. literalinclude:: ../plot_haxby_searchlight.py
    :start-after: ### Preprocess data ###########################################################
    :end-before: ### Prepare the masks #########################################################

Masking
-------

One of the main element that distinguich Searchlight from other algorithms is
this notion of structuring element that scan the entire volume. If this seems
rather intuitive, it has in fact an impact on the masking procedure.

Most of the time, fMRI data is masked and then given to the algorithm. This is
not possible in the case of Searchlight because, to compute the score of
non-masked voxels, some masked voxels may be needed. This is why two masks will
be used here :

- *mask* is the anatomical mask
- *process_mask* is a subset of mask and contains voxels to be processed.

*process_mask* will then be used to restrain computation to one slice, in the
back of the brain. *mask* will ensure that no value outside of the brain is
taken into account when iterating with the sphere.

        :end-before: ### Restrict to faces and houses ##############################################

Restricting the dataset
-----------------------

Like in the :ref:`decoding <fmri_decoding>` example, we limit our
analysis to the `face` and `house` conditions:

.. literalinclude:: ../plot_haxby_searchlight.py
    :start-after: ### Restrict to faces and houses ##############################################
    :end-before: ### Searchlight ###############################################################
	
Third Step: Setting up the searchlight
=======================================

Classifier
----------

The classifier used by default by Searchlight is LinearSVC with C=1 but
this can be customed easily by passing an estimator parameter to the
cross validation. See scikit-learn documentation for `other classifiers
<http://scikit-learn.org/supervised_learning.html>`_.

Score function
--------------

Here we use precision as metrics to measures proportion of true positives
among all positives results for one class. Many others are available in
`scikit-learn documentation
<http://scikit-learn.org/supervised_learning.html>`_.

.. literalinclude:: ../plot_haxby_searchlight.py
    :start-after: # all positives results for one class.
    :end-before: ### Define the cross-validation scheme used for validation.

Cross validation
----------------

Searchlight will iterate on the volume and give a score to each voxel. This
score is computed by running a classifier on selected voxels. In order to make
this score as accurate as possible (and avoid overfitting), a cross validation
is made.

As Searchlight is a little costly, we have chosen a cross validation
method that do not take too much time. *K*-Fold along with *K* = 4 is a
good compromise between running time and result.

.. literalinclude:: ../plot_haxby_searchlight.py
    :start-after: # set once and the others as learning sets
    :end-before: ### Fit #######################################################################

Running Searchlight
===================

Running Searchlight is straightforward now that everything is set. The only
parameter left is the radius of the ball that will run through the data.
Kriegskorte uses a 4mm radius because it yielded the best detection
performance in his simulation.

Visualisation
=============

Searchlight
-----------

As the activation map is cropped, we use the mean image of all scans as a
background. We can see here that voxels in the visual cortex contains
information to distinguish pictures showed to the volunteer, which was the
expected result.

    :end-before: ### Show the F_score

Comparing to standard-analysis: F_score or SPM
------------------------------------------------

The standard approach to brain mapping is performed using *statistical
parametric mapping* (SPM), using ANOVA (analysis of variance), and F
tests. Here we use is to compute the *p-values* of the voxels [1]_.
To display the results, we use the negative log of the p-value.

   :scale: 60

.. literalinclude:: ../plot_haxby_searchlight.py
    :start-after: ### Show the F_score

.. [1]

    The *p-value* is the probability of getting the observed values
    assuming that nothing happens (i.e. under the null hypothesis).
    Therefore, a small *p-value* indicates that there is a small chance
    of getting this data if no real difference existed, so the observed
    voxel must be significant.
