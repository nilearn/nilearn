Searchlight : finding voxels containing information
===========================================================

.. currentmodule:: nilearn.decoding

Principle of the Searchlight
============================

Searchlight was introduced in `Information-based functional brain mapping
<http://www.pnas.org/content/103/10/3863>`_, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte,
Rainer Goebel and Peter Bandettini (PNAS 2006) and consists in scanning the
images volume with a *searchlight*. Briefly, a ball of given radius is
scanned across the brain volume and the prediction accuracy of a
classifier trained on the corresponding voxels is measured.

Preparing the data
====================

Loading
-------

Fetching the data from internet and loading it can be done with the
provided functions (see :ref:`loading_data`):

.. literalinclude:: ../../plot_haxby_searchlight.py
    :start-after: ### Load Haxby dataset ################################
    :end-before: ### Restrict to faces and houses #######################

Reshaping the data
-------------------

For this example we need:

- to put X in the form *n_samples* x *n_features*
- compute a mean image for visualization background
- limit our analysis to the `face` and `house` conditions
  (like in the :ref:`decoding <fmri_decoding>` example)

.. literalinclude:: ../../plot_haxby_searchlight.py
    :start-after: ### Restrict to faces and houses ###################
    :end-before: ### Prepare masks ###################################

Masking
-------

One of the main elements that distinguish Searchlight from other algorithms is
the notion of structuring element that scans the entire volume. If this seems
rather intuitive, it has in fact an impact on the masking procedure.

Most of the time, fMRI data is masked and then given to the algorithm. This is
not possible in the case of Searchlight because, to compute the score of
non-masked voxels, some masked voxels may be needed. This is why two masks will
be used here :

- *mask* is the anatomical mask
- *process_mask* is a subset of mask and contains voxels to be processed.

*process_mask* will then be used to restrain computation to one slice, in the
back of the brain. *mask* will ensure that no value outside the brain is
taken into account when iterating with the sphere.

Third Step: Setting up the searchlight
=======================================

Classifier
----------

The classifier used by default by :class:`SearchLight` is LinearSVC with C=1 but
this can be customed easily by passing an estimator parameter to the
cross validation. See scikit-learn documentation for `other classifiers
<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html>`_.

Score function
--------------

Here we use precision as metrics to measure the proportion of true
positives among all positive results for one class. Others metrics can be
specified by the "scoring" argument to the :class:`SearchLight`, as
detailed in the `scikit-learn documentation
<http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/model_evaluation.html#the-scoring-parameter-defining-model-evaluation-rules>`_

Cross validation
----------------

:class:`SearchLight` will iterate on the volume and give a score to each voxel. This
score is computed by running a classifier on selected voxels. In order to make
this score as accurate as possible (and avoid overfitting), a cross validation
is made.

As :class:`SearchLight` is computationally costly, we have chosen a cross
validation method that does not take too much time.
*K*-Fold along with *K* = 4 is a
good compromise between running time and quality.

.. literalinclude:: ../plot_haxby_searchlight.py
    :start-after: # set once and the others as learning sets
    :end-before: import nilearn.decoding

Running Searchlight
===================

Running :class:`SearchLight` is straightforward now that everything is set.
The only
parameter left is the radius of the ball that will run through the data.
Kriegskorte et al. use a 4mm radius because it yielded the best detection
performance in their simulation.

.. literalinclude:: ../../plot_haxby_searchlight.py
    :start-after: # The radius is the one of the Searchlight sphere
    :end-before: ### F-scores computation ############################
	
Visualization
=============

Searchlight
-----------

As the activation map is cropped, we use the mean image of all scans as a
background. We can see here that voxels in the visual cortex contains
information to distinguish pictures showed to the volunteers, which was the
expected result.
