============================
The nilearn building blocks
============================

In this section of the nilearn documentation, we describe the building
blocks that can be assembled to create a machine-learning data analysis
pipeline. This section is slightly more advanced and abstract than the
previous section, on specific :ref:`data_analysis`. It provides knowledge
that is useful to go off the beaten path in terms of data processing.
