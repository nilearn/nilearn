NILEARN: neuroimaging with the scikit-learn
===========================================

This repository contains code and documentation to use the scikit-learn
( http://scikit-learn.org ) for neuroimaging data analysis. The only
requirements are scikit-learn and nibabel ( http://nipy.org/nibabel ), as
well as their dependencies (numpy, scipy and matplotlib).

The code comes with fully-runnable examples that download the data
required from Internet.
