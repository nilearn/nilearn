Fetching open datasets
----------------------

The nilearn package provides a dataset fetching utility that
automatically downloads reference
datasets and atlases. Dataset fetching functions can be imported from
:mod:`nilearn.datasets`::

    >>> from nilearn import datasets
    >>> haxby_dataset = datasets.fetch_haxby(n_subjects=1)  # doctest: +SKIP

They return a data structure that contains different pieces of
information on the retrieved dataset, including the
file names on hard disk::

    >>> # The different files
    >>> print(sorted(list(haxby_dataset.keys())))  # doctest: +SKIP
    ['anat', 'description', 'func', 'mask', 'mask_face', 'mask_face_little',
    'mask_house', 'mask_house_little', 'mask_vt', 'session_target']
    >>> # Path to first functional file
    >>> print(haxby_dataset.func[0])  # doctest: +SKIP
    /.../nilearn_data/haxby2001/subj1/bold.nii.gz

Explanation and further resources of the dataset at hand can be retrieved as
follows::

    >>> print(haxby_dataset.description)  # doctest: +SKIP
    Haxby 2001 results

    :ref:`datasets_ref`.

.. topic:: **nilearn_data: Where is the downloaded data stored?**

    The fetching functions download the reference datasets to the disk.
    They save it locally for future use, in one of the
    following directories (in order of priority, if present):

     * the folder specified by `data_dir` parameter in the fetching function
     * the global environment variable `NILEARN_SHARED_DATA`
     * the user environment variable `NILEARN_DATA`
     * the `nilearn_data` folder in the user home folder

    The two different environment variables (NILEARN_SHARED_DATA and
    NILEARN_DATA) are provided for multi-user systems, to distinguish a
    global dataset repository that may be read-only at the user-level.
    Note that you can copy that folder to another user's computers to
    avoid the initial dataset download on the first fetching call.


Loading your own data: filenames or Nibabel objects
----------------------------------------------------

Function in nilearn can take filenames or nibabel in-memory object.

Using your own data images in nilearn is as simple as giving the file
name, or list of file name strings ::

    >>> # dataset folder contains subject1.nii and subject2.nii
    >>> from nilearn.image import smooth_img
    >>> result_img = smooth_img(['dataset/subject1.nii', 'dataset/subject2.nii']) # doctest: +SKIP

``result_img`` is a 4D in-memory image, containing the data of both
subjects.

**Filename matching** Nilearn also provides a "wildcard" pattern to list
many files with one expression:

 * **Matching multiple files**: suppose the dataset folder contains
   subject_01.nii to subject_03.nii ``dataset/subject_*.nii`` is a glob
   expression matching all filenames::

    >>> # Example with a smoothing process:
    >>> from nilearn.image import smooth_img
    >>> result_img = smooth_img("dataset/subject_*.nii") # doctest: +SKIP

 * **Expanding the home directory** ``~`` is expanded to your home
   directory::

    >>> result_img = smooth_img("~/dataset/subject_01.nii") # doctest: +SKIP

.. topic:: **Python globbing**

    For more complicated use cases, Python also provides functions to work
    with file paths, in particular, :func:`glob.glob`.

    .. warning::

        Unlike nilearn's path expansion, the result of :func:`glob.glob` is
        not sorted and depending on the computer you are running they
        might not be in alphabetic order. We advise you to rely on
        nilearn's path expansion.

Understanding neuroimaging data
===============================

Nifti and Analyze data
-----------------------

For volumetric data, nilearn works with data stored as in the Nifti
structure (via the nibabel_ package).

The `NifTi <http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/>`_ data structure (also used in
Analyze files) is the standard way of sharing data in neuroimaging
research. Three main components are:

:data:
    raw scans in form of a numpy array: ``data = img.get_data()``
:affine:
    returns the transformation matrix that maps
    from voxel indices of the numpy array to actual real-world
    locations of the brain:
    ``affine = img.get_affine()``
:header:
    low-level informations about the data (slice duration, etc.):
    ``header = img.get_header()``

If you need to load the data without using nilearn, read the nibabel_
documentation.


.. topic:: **Dataset formatting: data shape**

    It is important to appreciate two main representations for
    storing and accessing more than one Nifti images, that is sets
    of MRI scans:

    - a big 4D matrix representing (3D MRI + 1D for time), stored in a single
      Nifti file.
      `FSL <http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/>`_ users tend to
      prefer this format.
    - several 3D matrices representing each time point (single 3D volume) of the
      session, stored in set of 3D Nifti or analyse files.
      `SPM <http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/>`_ users tend
      to prefer this format.

.. _niimg:

Niimg-like objects
-------------------

Nilearn functions take as input argument what we call "Niimg-like
objects":

**Niimg:** A Niimg-like object can be one of the following:

  * A string with a file path to a Nifti or Analyse image
  * Any object exposing ``get_data()`` and ``get_affine()`` methods, typically
    a ``Nifti1Image`` from nibabel_.

**Niimg-4D:** Similarly, some functions require 4D Nifti-like
data, which we call Niimgs or Niimg-4D. Accepted input arguments are:

  * A path to a 4D Nifti image
  * List of paths to 3D Nifti images
  * 4D Nifti-like object
  * List of 3D Nifti-like objects

.. topic:: **Image affines**

   If you provide a sequence of Nifti images, all of them must have the same
   affine.

Text files: phenotype or behavior
----------------------------------

Phenotypic or behavioral data are often provided as text or CSV
(Comma Separated Values) file. They
can be loaded with `numpy.genfromtxt` but you may have to specify some options
(typically `skip_header` ignores column titles if needed).

For the Haxby datasets, we can load the categories of the images
presented to the subject::

    >>> from nilearn import datasets
    >>> haxby_dataset = datasets.fetch_haxby(n_subjects=1)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> labels = np.recfromcsv(haxby_dataset.session_target[0], delimiter=" ")  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> stimuli = labels['labels']  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print(np.unique(stimuli))  # doctest: +SKIP
    ['bottle' 'cat' 'chair' 'face' 'house' 'rest' 'scissors' 'scrambledpix'
     'shoe']

.. topic:: **Reading CSV with pandas**

    `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ is a powerful package to read
    data from CSV files and manipulate them.

Masking data manually
=====================

Extracting a brain mask
------------------------

If we do not have a spatial mask of the target regions, a brain mask
can be easily extracted from the fMRI data by the
:func:`nilearn.masking.compute_epi_mask` function:

.. figure:: ../auto_examples/01_plotting/images/sphx_glr_plot_visualization_002.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/01_plotting/plot_visualization.html
    :align: right
    :scale: 50%

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/01_plotting/plot_visualization.py
     :start-after: # Extracting a brain mask
     :end-before: # Applying the mask to extract the corresponding time series


.. _mask_4d_2_3d:

From 4D Nifti images to 2D data arrays
--------------------------------------

fMRI data is usually represented as a 4D block of data: 3 spatial
dimensions and one time dimension. In practice, we are usually
interested in working on the voxel time-series in the
brain. It is thus convenient to apply a brain mask in order to convert the
4D brain images representation into a restructured 2D data representation,
`voxel` **x** `time`, as depicted below:

.. image:: ../images/masking.jpg
    :align: center
    :width: 100%


.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/01_plotting/plot_visualization.py
     :start-after: # Applying the mask to extract the corresponding time series
     :end-before: # Find voxels of interest

.. figure:: ../auto_examples/01_plotting/images/sphx_glr_plot_visualization_003.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/01_plotting/plot_visualization.html

.. _preprocessing_functions:

Functions for data preparation steps
=====================================

.. currentmodule:: nilearn.input_data

The :class:`NiftiMasker` can automatically perform important data preparation
steps. These steps are also available as independent functions if you want to
set up your own data preparation procedure:

.. currentmodule:: nilearn

* Resampling: :func:`nilearn.image.resample_img` and :func:`nilearn.image.resample_to_img`.
  See the following examples:

  * affine transforms on data and bounding boxes: :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_04_manipulating_images_plot_affine_transformation.py`,
  * resample an image to a template reference image: :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_04_manipulating_images_plot_resample_to_template.py`.
 
* Computing the mean of images (along the time/4th dimension):
  :func:`nilearn.image.mean_img`
* Applying numpy functions on an image or a list of images:
  :func:`nilearn.image.math_img`
* Swapping voxels of both hemisphere (e.g., useful to homogenize masks
  inter-hemispherically):
  :func:`nilearn.image.swap_img_hemispheres`
* Smoothing: :func:`nilearn.image.smooth_img`
* Masking:

  * compute from EPI images: :func:`nilearn.masking.compute_epi_mask`

  confound removal, low/high pass filtering): :func:`nilearn.signal.clean`

.. _resampling:

Resampling images
=================

Resampling one image to match another
-------------------------------------

:func:`nilearn.image.resample_to_img` resamples an image to a reference
image.

.. topic:: **Example**

    * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_04_manipulating_images_plot_resample_to_template.py`

.. image:: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/images/sphx_glr_plot_resample_to_template_001.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_resample_to_template.html
    :scale: 55%

Resampling specific target affine, shape, or resolution
--------------------------------------------------------

The resampling procedure takes as input the
`target_affine` to resample (resize, rotate...) images in order to match
the spatial configuration defined by the new affine (i.e., matrix
transforming from voxel space into world space).

Additionally, a `target_shape` can be used to resize images
(i.e., cropping or padding with zeros) to match an expected data
image dimensions (shape composed of x, y, and z).

As a common use case, resampling can be a viable means to
downsample image quality on purpose to increase processing speed
and lower memory consumption of an analysis pipeline.
In fact, certain image viewers (e.g., FSLView) also require images to be
resampled to display overlays.

On an advanced note, automatic computation of offset and bounding box
can be performed by specifying a 3x3 matrix instead of the 4x4 affine.
In this case, nilearn computes automatically the translation part
of the transformation matrix (i.e., affine).

.. image:: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/images/sphx_glr_plot_affine_transformation_002.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_affine_transformation.html
    :scale: 33%
.. image:: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/images/sphx_glr_plot_affine_transformation_004.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_affine_transformation.html
    :scale: 33%
.. image:: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/images/sphx_glr_plot_affine_transformation_003.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_affine_transformation.html
    :scale: 33%


.. topic:: **Special case: resampling to a given voxel size**

   Specifying a 3x3 matrix that is diagonal as a target_affine fixes the
   voxel size. For instance to resample to 3x3x3 mm voxels::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> target_affine = np.diag((3, 3, 3))


Image operations: creating a ROI mask manually
===============================================

This section shows manual steps to create and further modify a ROI
(region of interest) spatial mask. They represent a means for "data folding",
that is, extracting and later analyzing data from a subset of voxels rather
than the entire brain images. As a convenient side effect, this can help
alleviate the curse of dimensionality (i.e., statistical problems that
arise in the context of high-dimensional input variables).

Smoothing
---------

Functional MRI data have a low signal-to-noise ratio (yet much better
than EEG or MEG measurements).
When using simple methods
that are not robust to noise, it is useful to apply a spatial filtering
kernel on the data. Such data smoothing is
usually applied using a Gaussian function with 4mm to 12mm full-width at
half-maximum (this is where the FWHM comes from).
The function :func:`nilearn.image.smooth_img` accounts for potential
anisotropy in the image affine (i.e., non-identical voxel size in all
the three dimensions). Analogous to the majority of nilearn functions,
it can also use file names as input parameters.


.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.py
    :start-after: # Smooth the data
    :end-before: # Run a T-test for face and houses

.. figure:: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/images/sphx_glr_plot_roi_extraction_001.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.html
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

Selecting features
------------------

Functional MRI data can be considered "high dimensional" given the
p-versus-n ratio (e.g., p=~50,000-200,000 voxels for n=1000 samples).
In this setting, machine-learning
algorithms can perform poorly (i.e., curse-of-dimensionality problem).
However, simple means from the realms of classical statistics can help
reducing the number of voxels.

The Student's t-test (:func:`scipy.stats.ttest_ind`) is an established
method to determine whether two
distributions are statistically different. It can be used to compare voxel
time-series from two different experimental conditions
(e.g., when houses or faces are shown to individuals during brain scanning).
If the time-series distribution is similar in the two conditions, then the
voxel is not very interesting to discriminate the condition.

This test returns p-values that represent probabilities that the two
time-series had been drawn from the same distribution. The lower is the p-value, the
more discriminative is the voxel in distinguishing the two conditions.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.py
    :start-after: # Run a T-test for face and houses
    :end-before: # Build a mask from this statistical map

.. figure:: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/images/sphx_glr_plot_roi_extraction_002.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.html
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

This feature selection method is available in the scikit-learn Python
package, where it has been
extended to several classes, using the
:func:`sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif` function.

Thresholding
------------

Voxels with better p-values are kept as voxels of interest.
Applying a threshold to an array
is easy thanks to numpy indexing à la Matlab.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.py
    :start-after: # Thresholding
    :end-before: # Binarization and intersection with VT mask

.. figure:: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/images/sphx_glr_plot_roi_extraction_003.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.html
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

Mask intersection
-----------------

We now want to restrict our investigation to the ventral temporal area. The
corresponding spatial mask is provided in `haxby.mask_vt`.
We want to compute the
intersection of this provided mask with our self-computed mask.
The first step is to load it with
nibabel's **nibabel.load**. We can then use a logical "and" operation
-- **numpy.logical_and** -- to keep only voxels
that have been selected in both masks. In neuroimaging jargon, this is
called an "AND conjunction."

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.py
    :start-after: # Binarization and intersection with VT mask
    :end-before: # Dilation

.. figure:: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/images/sphx_glr_plot_roi_extraction_004.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.html
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

Mask dilation
-------------

Tresholded functional brain images often contain scattered voxels
across the brain.
To consolidate such brain images towards more
compact shapes, we use a `morphological dilation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology)>`_. This is a common step to be sure
not to forget voxels located on the edge of a ROI.
Put differently, such operations can fill "holes" in masked voxel
representations.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.py
    :start-after: # Dilation
    :end-before: # Identification of connected components

.. figure:: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/images/sphx_glr_plot_roi_extraction_005.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.html
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

Extracting connected components
-------------------------------

The function **scipy.ndimage.label** from the scipy Python library
identifies immediately neighboring
voxels in our voxels mask. It assigns a separate integer label to each
one of them.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.py
    :start-after: # Identification of connected components
    :end-before: # Use the new ROIs to extract data maps in both ROIs

.. figure:: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/images/sphx_glr_plot_roi_extraction_006.png
    :target: ../auto_examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.html
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

Saving the result
-----------------

The final voxel mask is saved using nibabel for further inspection
with a software such as FSLView.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/04_manipulating_images/plot_roi_extraction.py
    :start-after: # save the ROI 'atlas' to a single output Nifti

.. _nibabel: http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nibabel/
