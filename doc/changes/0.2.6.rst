0.2.6
=====

**Released September 2016**

This release enhances usage of several functions by fine tuning their parameters.
It allows to select which Haxby subject to fetch.
It also refactors documentation to make it easier to understand.
``Sphinx-gallery`` has been updated and nilearn is ready for new ``nibabel 2.1`` version.
Several bugs related to masks in Searchlight and ABIDE fetching have been resolved.

Fixes
-----

- Change default ``dtype`` in function :func:`~image.concat_imgs` to be the original type of the data (see :gh:`1238`).

- Fix ``SearchLight`` that did not run without ``process_mask`` or with one :term:`voxel` mask.

- Fix flipping of left hemisphere when plotting glass brain.

- Fix bug when downloading ABIDE timeseries.

Enhancements
------------

- ``Sphinx-gallery`` updated to version ``0.1.3``.

- Refactoring of examples and documentation.

- Better ordering of regions in function :func:`~datasets.fetch_coords_dosenbach_2010`.

- Remove outdated power atlas example.


Changes
-------

- The parameter ``n_subjects`` is deprecated and will be removed in future release. Use ``subjects`` instead in function :func:`~datasets.fetch_haxby`.

- The function :func:`~datasets.fetch_haxby` will now fetch the data accepting input given in ``subjects`` as a list than integer.

- Replace ``get_affine`` by ``affine`` with recent versions of ``nibabel``.
