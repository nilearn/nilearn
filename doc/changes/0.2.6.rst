=====

**Released September 2016**

This release enhances usage of several functions by fine tuning their parameters.
It allows to select which Haxby subject to fetch.
It also refactors documentation to make it easier to understand.
``Sphinx-gallery`` has been updated and nilearn is ready for new ``nibabel 2.1`` version.
Several bugs related to masks in Searchlight and ABIDE fetching have been resolved.
