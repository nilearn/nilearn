- New example in
  :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_07_advanced_plot_beta_series.py`
  to demonstrate how to implement common beta series models with nilearn.
- Function :func:`~plotting.plot_carpet` now accepts a ``t_r`` parameter, which allows users to provide the TR of the image when the image's header may not be accurate. (:gh:`3165` by `Taylor Salo`_).
- Terms :term:`Probabilistic atlas` and :term:`Deterministic atlas` were added to the glossary and references were added to atlas fetchers (:gh:`3152` by `Nicolas Gensollen`_).
