0.4.2
=====

**Released June 2018**

Few important bugs fix release for OHBM conference.

Changes
-------

- Default colormaps for surface plotting functions have changed to be more consistent with slice plotting. :func:`~plotting.plot_surf_stat_map` now uses ``cold_hot``, as :func:`~plotting.plot_stat_map` does, and :func:`~plotting.plot_surf_roi` now uses ``gist_ncar``, as :func:`~plotting.plot_roi` does.

- Improve 3D surface plotting: lock the aspect ratio of the plots and reduce the whitespace around the plots.

Fixes
-----

- Fix bug with input repetition time (:term:`TR`) which had no effect in signal cleaning (fixed by `Pradeep Reddy Raamana`_).

- Fix issues with signal extraction on list of 3D images in :class:`~regions.Parcellations`.

- Fix issues with raising ``AttributeError`` rather than ``HTTPError`` in datasets fetching utilities (by `Jerome Dockes`_).

- Fix issues in datasets testing function uncompression of files (by `Pierre Glaser`_).
