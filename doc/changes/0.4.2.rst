=====

Few important bugs fix release for OHBM conference.

Changes
-------
    - Default colormaps for surface plotting functions have changed to be more
      consistent with slice plotting.
      :func:`nilearn.plotting.plot_surf_stat_map` now uses "cold_hot", as
      :func:`nilearn.plotting.plot_stat_map` does, and
      :func:`nilearn.plotting.plot_surf_roi` now uses "gist_ncar", as
      :func:`nilearn.plotting.plot_roi` does.

    - Improve 3D surface plotting: lock the aspect ratio of the plots and
      reduce the whitespace around the plots.

Bug fixes
---------

    - Fix bug with input repetition time (TR) which had no effect in signal
      cleaning. Fixed by Pradeep Raamana.

    - Fix issues with signal extraction on list of 3D images in
      :class:`nilearn.regions.Parcellations`.

    - Fix issues with raising AttributeError rather than HTTPError in datasets
      fetching utilities. By Jerome Dockes.

    - Fix issues in datasets testing function uncompression of files. By Pierre Glaser.
