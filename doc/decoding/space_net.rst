SpaceNet: decoding with spatial structure for better maps
==========================================================

The SpaceNet decoder
=====================

:class:`nilearn.decoding.SpaceNetRegressor` and :class:`nilearn.decoding.SpaceNetClassifier`
implements spatial penalties which improve brain decoding power as well as decoder maps:

* penalty="tvl1": priors inspired from TV (Total Variation) [:footcite:t:`michel:inria-00563468`], TV-L1 [:footcite:t:`Baldassarre2012`], [:footcite:t:`gramfort:hal-00839984`].

* penalty="graph-net": GraphNet prior [:footcite:t:`GROSENICK2013304`].

These regularize :term:`classification` and :term:`regression`
problems in brain imaging. The results are brain maps which are both
sparse (i.e regression coefficients are zero everywhere, except at
predictive :term:`voxels<voxel>`) and structured (blobby). The superiority of TV-L1
over methods without structured priors like the Lasso, :term:`SVM`, :term:`ANOVA`,
Ridge, etc. for yielding more interpretable maps and improved
prediction scores is now well established [:footcite:t:`Baldassarre2012`], [:footcite:t:`gramfort:hal-00839984`], [:footcite:t:`GROSENICK2013304`].

Note that TV-L1 prior leads to a difficult optimization problem, and so can be slow to run.
Under the hood, a few heuristics are used to make things a bit faster. These include:

- Feature preprocessing, where an F-test is used to eliminate
  non-predictive :term:`voxels<voxel>`, thus reducing the size of the brain
  mask in a principled way.
- Continuation is used along the regularization path, where the
  solution of the optimization problem for a given value of the
  regularization parameter `alpha` is used as initialization
  for the next regularization (smaller) value on the regularization
  grid.

**Implementation:** See [:footcite:t:`dohmatob:hal-01147731`] and [:footcite:t:`dohmatob:hal-00991743`] for technical details regarding the implementation of SpaceNet.

.. note::

    Empirical comparisons using this method have been removed from
    documentation in version 0.7 to keep its computational cost low. You can
    easily try SpaceNet instead of FREM in :ref:`mixed gambles study <sphx_glr_auto_examples_02_decoding_plot_mixed_gambles_frem.py>` or :ref:`Haxby study <sphx_glr_auto_examples_02_decoding_plot_haxby_frem.py>`.

    :ref:`FREM <frem>`, a pipeline ensembling many models that yields very
    good decoding performance at a lower computational cost.
