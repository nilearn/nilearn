Hi! 
If you have: 
 -1 Questions about how to use Nistats or 
 -2 Need analysis suggestions & recommendations?

A bunch of fMRI researchers hang out at Neurostars (http://neurostars.org/). 
Post those questions there. 
Add the tag `nistats` (we get an email from Neurostars if you do).

Posting them here makes life more complicated for the Nistats developers.

<!--

For the Bug Report, 
Include this information:
-------------------------
What version of Nistats are you using?
What were you trying to do?
What did you expect will happen?
What actually happened?

List the steps you performed that revealed the bug to you.
Include any code samples. Enclose them in triple back-ticks (```)
Like this:
