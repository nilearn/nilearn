nilearn
=======

Nilearn enables approachable and versatile analyses of brain volumes. It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation & friendly community.

It supports general linear model (GLM) based analysis and leverages the `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_ Python toolbox for multivariate statistics with applications such as predictive modelling, classification, decoding, or connectivity analysis.

Office Hours
============

The nilearn office hours will not be held over the summer and will restart in September. See section `How to get help <https://nilearn.github.io/stable/development.html#how-to-get-help>`_ for ways you can still engage with the core-developer team.

Dependencies
============

The required dependencies to use the software are listed in the file `nilearn/setup.cfg <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/main/setup.cfg>`_.

If you are using nilearn plotting functionalities or running the examples, matplotlib >= 3.0 is required.

Some plotting functions in Nilearn support both matplotlib and plotly as plotting engines.
In order to use the plotly engine in these functions, you will need to install both plotly and kaleido, which can both be installed with pip and anaconda.

If you want to run the tests, you need pytest >= 3.9 and pytest-cov for coverage reporting.
